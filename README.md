# Garage Billing Application 🚗

A comprehensive console-based billing application built with Core Java, demonstrating complete implementation of Object-Oriented Programming concepts, Collection Framework, and Exception Handling.

## 📋 Overview

The Garage Billing Application is a Java-based system designed to manage garage operations and generate bills for services rendered. This project serves as a practical implementation of fundamental Java concepts and best practices in software development.

## ✨ Features

- **Billing Management**: Generate and manage bills for garage services
- **Customer Management**: Store and retrieve customer information
- **Service Tracking**: Track various garage services and their pricing
- **Invoice Generation**: Create detailed invoices for completed services
- **Data Persistence**: Store and manage data efficiently using Java Collections

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java (Core Java)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
- **Concepts Implemented**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Collection Framework
  - Exception Handling

## 📚 Core Java Concepts Demonstrated

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and access control
- **Inheritance**: Code reusability through class hierarchies
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading and overriding
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces

### Collection Framework
- ArrayList, HashMap, and other collection implementations
- Efficient data storage and retrieval
- Iterators and stream operations

### Exception Handling
- Try-catch blocks for robust error handling
- Custom exception classes
- Graceful error recovery mechanisms
